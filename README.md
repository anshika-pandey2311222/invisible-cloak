🧥 Invisible Cloak (Python + OpenCV)

This project is a fun computer vision application that creates the “invisibility cloak” effect using Python and OpenCV.
🔮 By detecting a specific color in the video feed (in this case red), the program replaces those pixels with the background, making it look like the object is invisible.
