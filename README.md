Invisible Cloak 🪄
This project is a fun computer vision application that creates the “invisibility cloak” effect using Python and OpenCV.
🔮 By detecting a specific color in the video feed (in this case red), the program replaces those pixels with the background, making it look like the object is invisible.

✨ Features
🎥 Real-time webcam video processing
🎨 Detects cloak color (e.g., red, blue, green)
🪄 Makes the cloak area invisible by blending with the background
⚡ Runs smoothly with OpenCV in Python
🚀 Tech Stack
Python 🐍
OpenCV 🎥
NumPy 🔢
⚙️ How It Works
Capture the static background for a few seconds.
Detect the cloak color using HSV color space.
Replace cloak pixels with the background → cloak disappears!

🚀 How It Works
Capture the background.
Detect the red color in each frame using HSV color space.
Replace the detected red regions with the background.
